<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am in the works of becoming a Junior Web Developer. I still have a lot to learn and hope to one day earn a role as a Senior Web Developer</p>

<p>I currently work as a patient navigator in a primary care office. My day to day involves making follow up appointments for patients, as well as provide any additional support services they may need, such as insurance renewal, housing/shelter, of help locating local food pantries. I also assist providers and clinical staff with medical interpretations for spanish-speaking patients.</p>

<p>I became interested in web devleopment a few months ago and completed a 3 month bootcamp with Generation USA, where I learned about file structures and to create websites using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also learn how to navigate GitHub to collaborate within a team.</p>
